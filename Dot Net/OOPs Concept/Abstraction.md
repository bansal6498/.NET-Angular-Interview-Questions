## Abstraction
-   Abstraction = Hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features.
-   It allows you to focus on what an object does, not how it does it.
-   In C#, abstraction is achieved using:
    -   Abstract classes
    -   Interfaces
### Using Abstract Classes
-   Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
-   They can contain abstract members (no implementation) and concrete members (with implementation).
-   Derived classes must implement abstract members.
#### Difference between Abstraction vs Encapsulation
**Answer:**
-   **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details.
-   **Encapsulation**: Hides data using access modifiers (private, public, etc.).
